START GAME
1. Generate a random 3-digit secret code (each digit 0–9, can repeat).
2. Initialize a guess counter.
3. LOOP: Ask the player to guess the 3-digit code via prompt().
    a. Validate the guess (3 digits, numeric).
    b. Convert guess and code to arrays of digits.
    c. Check for:
        - Correct digits in the correct place.
        - Correct digits in the wrong place.
    d. Show feedback using alert().
    e. If all 3 digits are correct and in the correct place → player wins, exit loop.
    f. Else → increment guess counter.
4. End the game with success or after max tries (e.g., 10 attempts).
